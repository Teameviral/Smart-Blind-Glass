# Smart Blind Glass System

According to the WHO, 39 billion people are blind. And the vision loss expert group has estimated that it will increase by 55 billion in the next few years. Our Smart Blind Glass is the all-in-one solution for a blind person. It can help a person detect obstacles,  recognise known faces, recognise currency, and recognise numbers and characters. We are committed to giving them a magical third eye, blessed by the latest technologies like artificial intelligence, facial recognition, image processing, wireless sensor networks, IOT, and embedded technologies. The cost of our smart blind glass is low and budget-friendly for all middle-class families. We are overwhelmed by all the team members whose continuous efforts and sleepless dedication make the project a grand success. We are looking forward to adding more features to this project if we receive any assistance in the future. Any corporate agencies, government organisations, and NGO's can come and join in our innovation and make it socially available by producing it commercially.
